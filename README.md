# Board-Game-Review-Prediction

This is a board game review prediction model developed using Sklearn library and implementing machine learning algorithms Linear Regression and Random Forest Classifier in Python. Numpy and Pandas were used for the data preprocessing.

Random Forest Classifier was found to be more efficient than Linear Regression.

Steps to download the dataset:-

1) Go to https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers.

2) Clone or Download the entire project.

3) Save "games.csv" from boardgamegeek folder.It is our dataset.


### Data Preprocessing :-


##### Histogram of Average Ratings (one of the core parameters in the dataset)
